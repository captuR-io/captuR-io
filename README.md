## Use Cases

1. **Media Verification**: Helps news organizations verify the authenticity of images and videos before publication.
2. **Financial Security**: Ensures financial institutions can safeguard against fraudulent videos used in identity theft or scams.
3. **Government Surveillance**: Protects public information by analyzing and flagging potential deepfake content used for misinformation or disinformation campaigns.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (version depends on the model used)
- ffmpeg (for handling video files)
- GPU (recommended for faster processing)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/captuR.git
   cd captuR
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (update with your paths):

   ```bash
   export CAPTUR_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/your/model
   export CAPTUR_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. (Optional) To run with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker build -t captur-detection .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 captur-detection
   ```

## Usage

Once captuR is running, you can use the following API endpoint to analyze media files for deepfakes:

### API Endpoint

- **POST** `/analyze`

  **Request**:

  ```json
  {
    "file": "path/to/media/file"
  }
  ```

  **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "confidence_score": 95.7,
    "is_deepfake": true
  }
  ```

## Model Training & Fine-Tuning
